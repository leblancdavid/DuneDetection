\begin_layout Title
Automated crest-line detection and analysis of sand dune patterns on planetary
 surfaces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Sand dunes are commonly occurring patterns in desert regions on many planets,
 and range in complexity.
 Dune-field patterns are believed to behave as self-organizing systems,
 but what causes the patterns to form is still poorly understood.
 Extracting meaningful features such as crest length, orientation, spacing,
 bifurcations and merging of crests can reveal important information about
 a specific region's climate and morphological properties.
 The goal of this project is to develop an automated crest-line detection
 method to extract the desired features from images of dune fields.
 The approach investigates various appearance and gradient-based techniques
 to retrieve the crest-line segments.
 Edges are extracted from the images and filtered based on a histogram of
 the gradient directions, and the individual magnitude of the gradients.
 Peaks in the normalized histogram of gradients has shown to reliably determine
 the overall orientation of the dune field.
 Once the crest-line candidates are detected, further filtering and computation
 of important features can be done.
 Preliminary results of this approach are promising.
